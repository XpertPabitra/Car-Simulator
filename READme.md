# 🏎️ Car Simulator (Pygame Project)

![Car Simulator]

**Car Simulator** is a 2D interactive driving simulator developed in **Python** using **Pygame**. Players control a car 🚗 on a vertical road and dodge incoming traffic 🛑 while scoring points for each avoided car 📊. The simulator includes **collision detection, multiple enemy cars, dynamic scoring, sound effects 🎵, and a restart option 🔁**. It provides hands-on experience in **game loops, event handling, animations, image handling, and real-time updates**.  

Gameplay is simple: move the car using **Left (⬅️)** and **Right (➡️)** arrow keys, avoid incoming cars, and try to get the **highest score**. Enemy cars appear randomly and increase in speed over time 🏎️. When a crash occurs 💥, the game stops, displays the score, and pressing **Enter** restarts the simulator.
